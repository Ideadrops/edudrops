========
to have better resources and areas to access documents and materials from a class with a "help area" for those needeing it in their classes.

the basic gist
======== 
Teachers can group projects and materials (notes, presentations) together with an area or board made just for the students to ask questions and have answered by other students and to have them further explain it to them with a whiteboard and chat system (those asking questions have the possibility of being anonymous to avoid fright, and get the best experience without the idea of making a fool of themselves, and those that are answering are public, (teachers may see user accounts if public or not due to liability and spam measures) 

resources uploaded
========
All materials presented can be downloaded or coded so people can't download them locally (teachers choosing)

who would use this service?
========
Can be used for schools, coding, how to's, complete classes, cooking, and many more. 
Paying Package based on how many people per class.
